To choose which 8 channels a Mackie Control surface controls, use the "BANK LEFT" and "BANK RIGHT" buttons, which allow you to navigate through "banks" of eight channels at a time; essentially, pressing these buttons lets you switch between sets of 8 channels you can control with the faders and knobs on the surface.
